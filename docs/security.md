🔹 Code Structure & Security

✅ Implemented Security Measures

1️⃣ Reentrancy Attack Protection → Uses nonReentrant in staking and unstaking to prevent reentrancy exploits.
2️⃣ Supply Limit → Hard cap of 1B $BABE with strict validations to avoid infinite minting.
3️⃣ Nation-Specific Mining Limits → Each nation has a max of 1M $BABE per day, adjustable based on growth and level.
4️⃣ Sybil Attack Protection → Only verified users can vote, and they must stake at least 100 $BABE.
5️⃣ Flash Loan Protection → Snapshot of supply before voting and a 7-day minimum staking period before participation.
6️⃣ Mining Cooldown System → Users must periodically interact with the platform to continue mining, preventing bot exploitation.
7️⃣ Automated Anomaly Detection → AI Stewards monitor exploit patterns and dynamically adjust mining supply caps.
