Babel DAO ($BABE)

📌 Description

Babel DAO is a decentralized ecosystem based on ENS, DAOs, and DeFi, designed to create a fair and attack-resistant governance model.

$BABE is the core token of this ecosystem, used for staking, mining, and voting in the global DAO. Each ENS Nation has its own mining and governance system, managed by an AI Steward.

🔹 Key Features

Subname minting on ENS → Users can mint subnames and participate in local governance.

Staking with scalable benefits → More experience means higher rewards.

Dynamic mining (Degens vs. Regens) → Self-regulated risk/reward models.

Global DAO and Local DAOs → Multi-level governance with advanced security.

Attack protection → Flash Loans, Sybil Attacks, Reentrancy, and more.


🔹 Mining in Babel DAO: Degens vs. Regens

✅ Two self-regulating mining styles:

Degens → High-risk mining with a chance to double rewards, but a 10% chance of losing everything (burned tokens reinforce deflationary mechanics).

Regens → Stable mining with consistent rewards and no loss risk, but with lower APR compared to Degens.

📌 Mining Rules:

Each Nation has a daily mining cap, scalable based on its level and activity.

Cooldown system ensures miners engage with the platform and prevents bot automation.

Mining patterns are monitored, and Nations with anomalies may see their mining cap progressively reduced.


🚀 Implementation Roadmap

1️⃣ Phase 1 (MVP): Subname minting + basic staking + local ENS governance.
2️⃣ Phase 2: Mining with Degens/Regens + dynamic burning mechanism.
3️⃣ Phase 3: Global DAO with $BABE voting + AI Stewards.
4️⃣ Phase 4: Metarooms and optional immersive layer.
5️⃣ Phase 5: ENS external integrations and multichain expansion.

🔒 Implemented Security Measures

Protection against Flash Loans → Snapshot of supply before voting, 7-day staking requirement before voting.

Protection against Sybil Attacks → Only verified users can vote, minimum 100 $BABE staked.

Protection against Reentrancy Attacks → nonReentrant used in key functions.

Protection against Infinite Minting → Dynamic emission limit of $BABE per Nation.

Protection against Excessive Mining → Cooldowns and daily supply reduction if abnormal patterns are detected.
